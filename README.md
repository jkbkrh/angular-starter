# angular-starter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Search angular-starter in the project and replace with the new name.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Angular 16 added experimental support for Jest but many features like coverage report or running single tests from IntelliJ did not work at the time.
So [jest-preset-angular](https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular) is used to run the tests.

Run `jest` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/testing-frameworks).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `playwright test` to execute the end-to-end tests.
